DataDog increases the transparency and visibility of the environments and data. This helps different parts of the organization to have access to the same information, by using the same observation platform. 

Also, many different parts of the infrastructure can  be monitored in the same application, which makes it much easier than having to read all individual parts' logs. 

In addition to this, DataDog automates the monitoring and logging processes, and when new infrastructures are created, they can be instantly monitored by DataDog.
