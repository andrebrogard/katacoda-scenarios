The goal of the tutorial is to teach you how to use DataDog, which is a monitoring service for applications. The tutorial runs completely on Katacoda and you do not need to install anything on your local computer. 

The tutorial is based on a simple "to-do" application that is already created, for which you will implement DataDog monitoring. 

## Structure of the tutorial: 

**Step 1:** Background information about DataDog

**Step 2:** Run the example application without DataDog

**Step 3:** Set up your DataDog account

**Step 4:** Integrate DataDog with the application

**Step 5:** Run the application and observe in DataDog
