## Conclusions

Now, you have learnt how to implement DataDog in a simple application.

As we could see, logging does not have to be difficult. In this tutorial we only looked at a JavaScript tracing solution, but DataDog does a great job of writing tracing solutions to many different languages and tools, they also provide many options for DataDog agents.   

The aggregated views of traces and active containers is the strenght of any monitoring solution. The improved insight and visibility is key to working efficiently.

Overall, there is a lot of different existing tools that can help you implement different DevOps concepts in your processes. In this tutorial, we concentrated on a specific tool which supports the 'monitor' part of DevOps, but other tools can be useful in other parts. Look at the image below to see if there is some other tools that you want to learn to implement next, but try to not get lost in the multitude of them! :)
